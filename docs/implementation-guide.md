## 🎯 Overview

Raft is a consensus algorithm designed to be more understandable than Paxos. This implementation guide provides a structured approach to building a Raft implementation from the ground up.

### ⭐ Key Features
- Leader Election
- Log Replication
- Safety Properties
- Membership Changes

## 🔧 Core Components

### 👥 Node Roles
1. **Follower**
   - Passive role, receives and responds to requests
   - Transitions to Candidate if election timeout occurs

2. **Candidate**
   - Initiates elections
   - Requests votes from other nodes
   - Transitions to Leader if majority votes received

3. **Leader**
   - Manages cluster operations
   - Sends heartbeats
   - Replicates log entries

## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

### 🔄 Phase 1: Single Node Implementation
1. Initialize basic node structure
2. Implement state transitions
3. Set up basic storage mechanisms
4. Verify role transitions (Follower → Candidate → Leader)

### 🔄 Phase 2: Multi-Node Communication
1. Add second node
2. Implement basic communication
3. Test leader election between nodes
4. Add message passing infrastructure

### 🔄 Phase 3: Full Cluster Implementation
1. Scale to multiple nodes
2. Implement log replication
3. Handle network partitions
4. Add fault tolerance mechanisms

## ⚡ State Transitions

### 🔄 State Machine Rules
1. **Follower State**
   - Reset election timer on heartbeat
   - Transition to Candidate if election timeout occurs
   - Accept and store log entries from leader

2. **Candidate State**
   - Increment term
   - Vote for self
   - Request votes from other nodes
   - Transition to Leader if majority achieved
   - Return to Follower if valid leader found

3. **Leader State**
   - Send periodic heartbeats
   - Manage log replication
   - Track follower progress
   - Handle configuration changes

## 💾 Storage and Persistence

### 📦 Storage Components
1. **In-Memory Storage**
   - Initial implementation using `raft.NewMemoryStorage()`
   - Suitable for testing and development

2. **Persistent Storage**
   - Store committed logs
   - Save hard state (term, vote, commit index)
   - Handle snapshots

### 🔄 State Recovery
1. Load snapshots
2. Restore hard state
3. Apply committed entries
4. Resume normal operation

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### ⚙️ Unit Tests
1. State transition tests
2. Log replication tests
3. Election process tests
4. Network partition handling

### 🔍 Integration Tests
1. Multi-node cluster tests
2. Fault tolerance scenarios
3. Performance benchmarks
4. Long-running stability tests

### ⚠️ Edge Cases to Test
- Split votes
- Network delays
- Node crashes and restarts
- Configuration changes
- Log conflicts

## 📋 Best Practices

1. **🛡️ Error Handling**
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Log important state changes
   - Add debugging tools

2. **⚡ Performance Considerations**
   - Optimize message batching
   - Implement efficient storage
   - Consider network optimization

3. **📊 Monitoring**
   - Track node states
   - Monitor election processes
   - Log replication metrics

## ✅ Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Basic node structure
- [ ] State transition logic
- [ ] Storage implementation
- [ ] Message passing system

## 📝 Notes

- Start with simple implementations and gradually add complexity
- Focus on correctness before optimization
- Maintain comprehensive logging for debugging
- Consider using channels for message passing in testing
- Plan for future network implementation (TCP/UDP)
