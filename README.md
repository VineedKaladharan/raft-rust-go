## üöÄ Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Simple Multi-Node Implementation üîÑ
> **Status:** `üü¢ In Progress`

üîÑ Basic state machine `üü¢ In Progress`
  - Implementation of core state machine that processes and applies commands
  - Handles read/write operations and maintains consistent state
  - Ensures atomic execution of commands

‚è≥ Term management
  - Implementation of logical clock using term numbers
  - Handling term updates and comparisons
  - Term-based leader election protocol

‚è≥ Log storage
  - Persistent storage of log entries
  - Log entry format with term numbers and commands
  - Log consistency checking mechanisms

‚è≥ State transitions
  - Implementation of state persistence
  - Safe state transfer between nodes
  - Crash recovery handling

‚è≥ Role transitions (Follower ‚Üí Candidate ‚Üí Leader)
  - Election timeout management
  - Vote request and response handling
  - Leader heartbeat implementation
  - Role-specific behavior implementation

### Phase 2: Multi-Node Communication üåê
> **Status:** `‚ö™ Planned`

- [ ] Node communication setup
- [ ] Leader election implementation
- [ ] Basic log replication
- [ ] Simple membership management
- [ ] Message passing infrastructure

### Phase 3: Full Cluster Features ‚ö°
> **Status:** `‚ö™ Planned`

- [ ] Complete log replication
- [ ] Snapshot handling
- [ ] Membership changes
- [ ] Recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Fault tolerance

## üìå Tasks & Notes

### Tasks
- Created basic func to accept number of servers to run in random ports as async `üü¢ Done`
- Added timeout on each servers at random milliseconds. When any one of the servers' gets timed out, it becomes 'Leader'. Rest of the nodes becomes 'Follower' using global concurrent variable `üü¢ Done`
- Added func to generate random election timeout between 150-300ms `üü¢ Done`
- Added func to generate random heartbeat timeout between 100-200ms `üü¢ Done`

## üõ†Ô∏è Build and Run

### Go Implementation

```bash
# Build the Go implementation
cd raft-go
go build
 ./raft-go

# Or run directly without building
# Run with default 3 servers
go run main.go

# Run with custom number of servers (e.g., 5)
go run main.go -n 5

Example output:
```bash
