===== RAFT ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION NOTES =====

1. 👑 LEADER ELECTION
----------------
Key Components:
- Election Timer: Randomized timeout between 150-300ms
- Term Numbers: Monotonically increasing
- Vote Request/Response: Contains term number and log information

State Transitions:
- Follower → Candidate: When election timeout occurs
- Candidate → Leader: When majority votes received
- Any State → Follower: When higher term discovered

Implementation Points:
- Implement randomized election timer
- Track votes received per term
- Handle split votes gracefully
- Ensure single vote per term per node

2. 📝 LOG REPLICATION
----------------
Components:
- Log Entry Structure:
  * Term number
  * Index
  * Command/Data
  * State (uncommitted/committed)

Leader Responsibilities:
- Track nextIndex[] for each follower
- Track matchIndex[] for each follower
- Send AppendEntries with new logs
- Commit entries when replicated to majority

Follower Tasks:
- Verify log consistency
- Append new entries
- Reject inconsistent entries
- Update commit index

Edge Cases:
- Handle log inconsistencies
- Deal with lagging followers
- Manage conflicting entries
- Handle network delays

3. 🔒 SAFETY PROPERTIES
----------------
Log Matching:
- If logs have same index and term, they contain same commands
- If logs have same index and term, all previous entries are identical

Election Restrictions:
- Candidates must have all committed entries
- Leader must have all committed entries from previous terms

Commit Rules:
- Only commit entries from current term
- Entry committed when replicated to majority
- Previous entries also committed implicitly

4. 👥 MEMBERSHIP CHANGES
----------------
Configuration Change Process:
- Joint consensus approach
- Two-phase configuration change
- Handle mixed cluster states

Safety Considerations:
- Maintain quorum during transitions
- Handle leader changes during config change
- Ensure log consistency across membership changes

5. 💾 STORAGE AND PERSISTENCE
----------------
Required Persistent State:
- Current term
- Vote for current term
- Log entries
- Last applied index
- Commit index

Storage Operations:
- Save before responding to RPCs
- Recover state after crashes
- Handle partial writes
- Manage snapshots

6. 🌐 NETWORKING
----------------
Message Types:
- RequestVote RPC
- AppendEntries RPC
- InstallSnapshot RPC
- Response messages

Network Considerations:
- Handle message delays
- Deal with network partitions
- Manage reconnections
- Buffer messages appropriately

7. 🔄 IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH
----------------
Phase 1 - Single Node:
- Basic state machine
- Term management
- Log storage
- State transitions

Phase 2 - Basic Cluster:
- Node communication
- Leader election
- Basic log replication
- Simple membership

Phase 3 - Full Features:
- Complete log replication
- Snapshot handling
- Membership changes
- Recovery mechanisms

8. 🧪 TESTING STRATEGIES
----------------
Unit Tests:
- State transitions
- Log operations
- Term management
- Vote counting

Integration Tests:
- Multi-node scenarios
- Network partitions
- Node failures
- Config changes

Chaos Testing:
- Random message delays
- Node crashes
- Network partitions
- Message reordering

9. 📊 MONITORING AND DEBUGGING
----------------
Metrics to Track:
- Term changes
- Leader changes
- Log growth
- Commit latency
- Network delays

Debug Information:
- State transitions
- RPC contents
- Log operations
- Configuration changes

10. ⚡ OPTIMIZATION CONSIDERATIONS
----------------
Performance:
- Batch log entries
- Optimize network usage
- Efficient storage access
- Smart snapshot timing

Resource Usage:
- Memory management
- Storage efficiency
- Network bandwidth
- CPU utilization

===== 📋 IMPLEMENTATION NOTES =====
- Start with simple, working implementation
- Add complexity gradually
- Focus on correctness before optimization
- Maintain comprehensive logging
- Use Go channels for testing
- Plan for proper error handling
